// Package logger provides a simplified interface for initializing and configuring
// a structured logger, specifically built upon the Uber Zap logging library.
// It offers a straightforward way to create a logger with adjustable logging levels
// and operational modes (development vs production), along with the ability to add
// additional Zap-specific options for custom logging requirements. This package is essential
// for achieving consistent and configurable logging across different parts of the application.
